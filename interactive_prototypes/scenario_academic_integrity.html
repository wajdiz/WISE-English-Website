            <h2>What is Academic Integrity in Online Learning?</h2>
            <p>Academic integrity refers to honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in educational settings. In Qatar's educational system, which emphasizes both academic excellence and strong moral values, maintaining academic integrity is particularly important. Online learning environments present unique challenges to academic integrity, as digital tools can make cheating seem easier or less detectable.</p>
            <p>In Qatar and the GCC region, educational institutions follow strict academic integrity policies that align with both international standards and Islamic values of honesty (sidq) and trustworthiness (amanah). Violations of academic integrity not only have academic consequences but can also conflict with religious and cultural values that emphasize truthfulness and personal honor.</p>
            <p>The following scenarios illustrate common situations related to academic integrity in online learning environments in Qatar and provide guidance on how to respond effectively while upholding both academic and Islamic values.</p>

            <div class="scenario">
                <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Final exams at a prestigious school in Doha</p>
                <p>Youssef, 16, is preparing for his final exams at one of Qatar's top secondary schools. He receives an invitation to join a private WhatsApp group called "Grade 11 Exam Help." When he joins, he discovers that students are planning to share answers during the upcoming online physics exam. Some students are arguing that it's not really cheating since the pandemic has made learning difficult, while others are pressuring everyone to participate, saying "we need to help each other pass."</p>

                <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Academic Consequences:</strong> In Qatar's educational institutions, academic dishonesty can result in failing grades, academic probation, or even expulsion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moral and Religious Implications:</strong> Cheating conflicts with Islamic values of honesty (sidq) and trustworthiness (amanah), which are emphasized in Qatar's educational philosophy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Future Opportunities:</strong> Academic dishonesty records can affect university admissions, particularly for prestigious institutions in Qatar and abroad.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Relying on cheating prevents the development of genuine knowledge and skills needed for future success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family Honor:</strong> In Qatari society, academic dishonesty can reflect poorly on family reputation, which is highly valued.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="response-option recommended">
                <h3>Recommended: Decline Participation and Uphold Values</h3>
                <p>Respectfully decline to participate while explaining your values:</p>
                <p>"I appreciate the invitation, but I can't participate in sharing exam answers. This goes against both our school's academic integrity policy and my personal values. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught us that honesty is essential in all aspects of life. I'd be happy to join a proper study group where we help each other understand the material before the exam."</p>
                <p>This response demonstrates moral courage and aligns with both academic and Islamic values of honesty.</p>

            <div class="response-option recommended">
                <h3>Recommended: Suggest Ethical Alternatives</h3>
                <p>Offer constructive alternatives that support learning without compromising integrity:</p>
                <p>"Instead of sharing answers during the exam, why don't we create a study group to review the material together before the test? I can share some of the practice problems I've been working on, and we can help each other understand difficult concepts. This way, we all learn the material properly and don't risk our academic standing."</p>

                <p>"Okay, I'll help with questions 11-15. Just make sure no one finds out about this group."</p>
                <p>This response compromises personal integrity and academic honesty for social acceptance, contradicting both school policies and Islamic values.</p>

                <p>Noora, 17, is working on a group research project about sustainable development in Qatar for her environmental science class. Her group member, Latifa, shares her contribution—a three-page section that Noora recognizes as being copied directly from a Qatar Foundation research paper she read earlier. Latifa has changed a few words but has not cited the source or used quotation marks. When Noora mentions this, Latifa says, "It's fine, everyone uses online sources. Besides, the information is correct, so what's the problem?"</p>

                <h3>Recommended: Explain Plagiarism Concerns Clearly</h3>
                <p>Educate group members about plagiarism and its consequences:</p>
                <p>"I understand we're under time pressure, but what you've submitted is plagiarism—using someone else's work without proper citation. Our school uses plagiarism detection software, and this could result in all of us failing the project or worse. More importantly, as students, we should respect others' intellectual work and demonstrate academic integrity."</p>

                <p>Provide a constructive solution:</p>
                <p>"I can help you revise this section to use your own words and properly cite the Qatar Foundation research. We can work on it together tonight. It's better to submit quality work that truly represents our understanding, even if we need to ask the teacher for a short extension."</p>

                <h3>Not Recommended: Ignoring the Issue</h3>
                <p>Accepting plagiarism to avoid conflict:</p>

                <p>This response avoids temporary discomfort but compromises academic integrity and potentially subjects the entire group to serious consequences.</p>
