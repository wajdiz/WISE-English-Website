            <h2>What are Family Privacy Boundaries?</h2>
            <p>In Qatar and the GCC region, family privacy is highly valued and protected. Family privacy boundaries in online spaces refer to the limits of what personal family information should be shared publicly. This includes photos, videos, family events, personal achievements, and family discussions. In Muslim and Arab cultures, maintaining family honor and privacy is particularly important, and violating these boundaries can have significant social consequences.</p>
            <p>The following scenarios illustrate common situations where family privacy boundaries might be crossed online and provide guidance on how to respond effectively while respecting cultural values.</p>

The celebration includes many female family members who are dressed in their finest clothes but are not wearing hijab as they are in a private family setting.
